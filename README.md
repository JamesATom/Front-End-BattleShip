# Battleship Game Frontend

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of battleships! This is a frontend application for the classic Battleship game, where users place their own ships and try to guess the locations of enemy ships before the computer guesses theirs. This game was both an awesome and a challenging undertaking for a team of talented web developers[1].

## Features

- Standard game of battleship against the computer
- Users place their own ships
- Guess the locations of enemy ships

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Material-UI
- Next.js
- Typescript

## How to Run

This project uses Next.js and npm scripts for building, running, and linting the application. The scripts are defined in the `package.json` file[6][11].

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later[6]

### Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

### Scripts

The `package.json` file includes the following scripts[6]:

- `"dev": "next dev"`: Starts the Next.js application in development mode.
- `"build": "next build"`: Builds the application for production usage.
- `"start": "next start"`: Starts a Next.js production server.
- `"lint": "next lint"`: Sets up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

To run these scripts, use the `npm run` command followed by the script name. For example, to start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application[6].

## Linting

This project uses Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration. You can run the linter using the `npm run lint` command. The linter will check all files in the `pages/`, `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `src/` directories[3][9].
